 Adapts the tty settings to parity bits and to erase, kill,
 end-of-line and uppercase characters when it reads a login name.
 The program can handle 7-bit characters with even, odd, none or space
 parity, and 8-bit characters with no parity. The following special
-characters are recognized: Control-U (kill); DEL and
-backspace (erase); carriage return and line feed (end of line).

-\-h, \-\-flow\-control
+\-h
 Enable hardware (RTS/CTS) flow control. It is left up to the
 application to disable software (XON/XOFF) flow protocol where
 appropriate.
 .TP
-\-H, \-\-host \fIlogin_host\fP
-Write the specified \fIlogin_host\fP into the utmp file.  (Normally,
-no login host is given, since \fBagetty\fP is used for local hardwired
-connections and consoles. However, this option can be useful for
-identifying terminal concentrators and the like.)
-.TP
-\-i, \-\-noissue
+\-i
 Do not display the contents of \fI/etc/issue\fP (or other) before writing the
 login prompt. Terminals or communications hardware may become confused
 when receiving lots of text at the wrong baud rate; dial-up scripts
 may fail if the login prompt is preceded by too much text.

+\-f \fIissue_file\fP
+Display the contents of \fIissue_file\fP instead of \fI/etc/issue\fP.

+\-l \fIlogin_program\fP
 Invoke the specified \fIlogin_program\fP instead of /bin/login.
 This allows the use of a non-standard login program (for example,
 one that asks for a dial-up password or that uses a different
 password file).
 .TP
-\-L, \-\-local\-line[=\fImode\fP]
-Control the CLOCAL line flag.  The optional \fImode\fP argument is 'auto', 'always' or 'never'.
-If the \fImode\fP argument is omitted, then the default is 'always'.  If the
-\-\-local\-line option is not given at all, then the default is 'auto'.
-
-The \fImode\fP 'always' forces the line to be a local line with no need for carrier detect.
-This can be useful when you have a locally attached terminal where the serial line
-does not set the carrier-detect signal.
-
-The \fImode\fP 'never' explicitly clears the CLOCAL flag from the line setting and
-the carrier-detect signal is expected on the line.
-
-The \fImode\fP 'auto' (agetty default) does not modify the CLOCAL setting
-and follows the setting enabled by the kernel.
+\-H \fIlogin_host\fP
+Write the specified \fIlogin_host\fP into the utmp file. (Normally,

-Turn on support for detecting an uppercase-only terminal.  This setting
-will detect a login name containing only capitals as indicating an
-uppercase-only terminal and turn on some upper-to-lower case conversions.

-\-w, \-\-wait\-cr
+\-w 
 Wait for the user or the modem to send a carriage-return or a
 linefeed character before sending the \fI/etc/issue\fP (or other) file
 and the login prompt. Very useful in connection with the \-I option.
-.TP
-\-\-nohints
-Do not print hints about Num, Caps and Scroll Locks.
-.TP
-\-\-nohostname
-By default the hostname will be printed.  With this option enabled,
-no hostname at all will be shown.
-.TP
-\-\-long\-hostname
-By default the hostname is only printed until the first dot.  With
-this option enabled, the fully qualified hostname by gethostname()
-or (if not found) by getaddrinfo() is shown.
-.TP
-\-\-erase\-chars \fIstring\fP
-This option specifies additional characters that should be interpreted as a
-backspace ("ignore the previous character") when the user types the login name.
-The default additional \'erase\' has been \'#\', but since util-linux 2.23
-no additional erase characters are enabled by default.
-.TP
-\-\-kill\-chars \fIstring\fP
-This option specifies additional characters that should be interpreted as a
-kill ("ignore all previous characters") when the user types the login name.
-The default additional \'kill\' has been \'@\', but since util-linux 2.23
-no additional kill characters are enabled by default.

-.TP
-\-\-delay \fInumber\fP
-Sleep seconds before open tty.
-.TP
-\-\-nice \fInumber\fP
-Run login with this priority.
-.TP
-\-\-reload
-Ask all running agetty instances to reload and update their displayed prompts,

-exit. This feature might be unsupported on systems without Linux
-.BR inotify (7).
-.TP
-\-\-version
