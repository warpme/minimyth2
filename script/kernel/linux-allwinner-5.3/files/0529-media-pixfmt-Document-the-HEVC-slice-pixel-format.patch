Subject: [PATCH 174/175] media: pixfmt: Document the HEVC slice pixel format

Document the current state of the HEVC slice pixel format.
The format will need to evolve in the future, which is why it is
not part of the public API.

+	HEVC pipeline (using the :ref:`codec` and :ref:`media-request-api`).
+	Metadata associated with the frame to decode is required to be passed
+	through the following controls :
+        * ``V4L2_CID_MPEG_VIDEO_HEVC_SPS``
+        * ``V4L2_CID_MPEG_VIDEO_HEVC_PPS``

+	See the :ref:`associated Codec Control IDs <v4l2-mpeg-hevc>`.
+	Buffers associated with this pixel format must contain the appropriate
+	number of macroblocks to decode a full corresponding frame.

+	   This format is not yet part of the public kernel API and it
