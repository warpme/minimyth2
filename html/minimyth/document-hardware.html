          <p>
            Over the years, the computer industry has created a wide range of hardware.
            To support this hardware,
            <a href="https://www.kernel.org/">Linux</a>
            and
            <a href="http://xorg.freedesktop.org">Xorg</a>
            include hundreds of drivers.
            These drivers take space, which is at odds with MiniMyth2's goal to be small.
            In order to remain small, MiniMyth2 severely limits the
            <a href="https://www.kernel.org/">Linux</a>
            and
            <a href="http://xorg.freedesktop.org">Xorg</a>
            drivers that it includes.
            As a result, MiniMyth2 only supports a limited set of hardware.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, MiniMyth2 is constantly evolving.
            As I and others have had a need to run MiniMyth2 on new hardware,
            we have added support for this hardware to MiniMyth2.
            If you want to know whether or not hardware not listed here is supported, or
            if you want to request support for hardware not listed here,
            then
            <a href="https://github.com/warpme/minimyth2/issues">let us know</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Having said that, you will be better off using hardware that is widely used by the MiniMyth2 community.
            After all, MiniMyth2 naturally gets better testing on this hardware.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="cpu" class="section">
          <div class="heading">CPU</div>
          <p>
            One from key targets of MiniMyth2 is to use video hardware decode to off-load CPU from heavy tasks like HD video decode.
            If hardware video decode is working, MiniMyth2 CPU requirements are very low.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="gpu" class="section">
          <div class="heading">GPU</div>
          <p>
            For MiniMyth2, you should strongly consider using a motherboard with an integrated GPU (Graphics Processing Unit).
            Today's motherboard integrated GPUs are more than powerful enough for a Myth frontend,
            and a Myth frontend system based on a motherboard with an integrated GPU will usually be smaller and lower power
            than one based on a motherboard without an integrated GPU.
          </p>
          <p>
            No matter which GPU you choose, make sure that it has MiniMyth2 build-in driver support.
            Here is full list of <a href="document-supported-gfx-hardware.txt">supported graphic hardware</a>
          </p>
          <p>
            For graphics support, MiniMyth2 uses
            <a href="http://xorg.freedesktop.org">Xorg</a>
            along with the proprietary
            <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/unix.html">NVIDIA drivers</a>
            In order to keep MiniMyth2 small,
            a complete set of
            <a href="http://xorg.freedesktop.org">Xorg</a>
            drivers are not included in MiniMyth2.
            As a result, only Intel, Nvidia, AMD/ATI and VmWare GPUs are supported.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="sound" class="section">
          <div class="heading">Sound</div>
          <p>
            First, you should strongly consider using a motherboard with integrated sound.
            Today's motherboard integrated sound is more than sufficient for a Myth frontend,
            and a Myth frontend system based on a motherboard with integrated sound will usually be smaller and lower power
            than one based on a motherboard without integrated sound.
          </p>
          <p>
            For sound support, MiniMyth2 uses the
            <a href="http://www.alsa-project.org">ALSA</a>
            drivers included in
            <a href="https://www.kernel.org/">Linux</a>.
            In order to keep MiniMyth2 small,
            a complete set of
            <a href="http://www.alsa-project.org">ALSA</a>
            drivers are not included in MiniMyth2.
            As a result, many sound cards are not supported.
            However, the integrated sound chips on the supported motherboards are supported.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="memory" class="section">
          <div class="heading">Memory</div>
          <p>
            MiniMyth2 was developed to run as diskless appliance.
            As a result, except when using NFS to mount the root file system, MiniMyth2 runs with its entire compressed file system resident in memory.
            In addition, even when using NFS to mount the root file system, MiniMyth2 does not use a swap file.
            Therefore, MiniMyth2 requires more memory than a typical Myth frontend.
          </p>
          <p>
            How much RAM you need depends on things such as video output resolution, MythTV theme and music collection size.
            While some people have had success running MiniMyth2 with 1GB of RAM, I do not recommend it.
            I would recommend at least 2GB of RAM.
            For video output at higher resolutions (e.g. 1920x1080) I strongly recomend 2048MB of RAM (excluding Video memory).
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="remote" class="section">
          <div class="heading">Remote Control Receiver</div>
          <p>
            For remote control receiver support, MiniMyth2 uses
            <a href="http://www.lirc.org">LIRC</a>.
            Since people use many different remote control receivers,
            MiniMyth2 includes all the
            <a href="http://www.lirc.org">LIRC</a>
            drivers, except
            drivers that require lirc_gpio (which does not work with the 2.6.23 or newer kernels) and
            drivers that require lirc_parallel (which does not work with SMP kernels).
            Therefore, if your remote control receiver is
            <a href="http://www.lirc.org/html/table.html">supported by LIRC</a>
            and does not require one of the excluded modules,
            then it should be supported by MiniMyth2.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, nothing is that simple.
            <a href="http://www.lirc.org">LIRC</a>
            requires an 'lircd.conf' configuration file to map the signals received
            from your remote control by your remote control receiver to remote control key names.
            In addition,
            <a href="http://www.lirc.org">LIRC</a>
            requires an 'lircrc' configuration file to map the remote control key names to
            <a href="http://www.mythtv.org">MythTV</a> commands.
            MiniMyth2 does contain a Microsoft Media Center Edition (MCE) remote 'lircrc' and 'lircd.conf' configuration files
            that should work (though not optimally) with any MCE compatible remote.
            Therefore, for not MCE compatible remote control receiver and remote control, you will need to provide your
            own 'lircd.conf' and 'lircrc' configuration files.
          </p>
          <p>
            Personally, I use a Media Center Edition remote control receiver and remote control.
            As a result, the 'lircd.conf' and 'lircrc' configuration files for this remote control receiver and remote control 
            are default, buil-in configuration files in MiniMyth2.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have 'lircd.conf' and 'lircrc' configuration files for your remote control receiver and remote control
            that you would like included in MiniMyth2,
            then
            <a href="https://github.com/warpme/minimyth2/issues">let us know</a>
            the remote control receiver vendor and model,
            the remote control vendor and model,
            the 'lircd.conf' and 'lircrc' configuration files and
            (if you are using a remote control receiver that connects using USB)
            the output of the command 'lsusb' with the remote control receiver connected.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="lcd-vfd" class="section">
          <div class="heading">LCD and VFD</div>
          <p>
            For LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) and VFD (Vacuum Fluorescent Display) support, MiniMyth2 uses
            <a href="http://www.lcdproc.org">LCDproc</a>.
            Since people use many different LCDs and VFDs,
            MiniMyth2 includes all the
            <a href="http://lcdproc.sourceforge.net/docs/stable-0-5-x-user.html#drivers">LCDproc drivers</a>.
            Therefore, if your LCD or VFD is supported by
            <a href="http://www.lcdproc.org">LCDproc</a>,
            then it should be supported by MiniMyth2.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, nothing is that simple.
            <a href="http://www.lcdproc.org">LCDproc</a>
            requires an 'LCDd.conf' configuration file that depends on the LCD or VFD.
            While MiniMyth2 does include a default 'LCDd.conf' configuration file that should work well for many LCDs and VFDs,
            MiniMyth2 does not contain specific 'LCDd.conf' configuration files for most LCDs or VFDs.
            Therefore, for LCDs and VFDs for which the default 'LCDd.conf' configuration file is not sufficient
            and no specific 'LCDd.conf' configuration file is included,
            you will need to provide your own 'LCDd.conf' configuration file.
          </p>
          <p>
            Personally, I do not have an LCD or VFD since all my MiniMyth2 frontends are hidden.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have an 'LCDd.conf' configuration file for your LCD or VFD
            that you would like included in MiniMyth2,
            then
            <a href="https://github.com/warpme/minimyth2/issues">let us know</a>
            the LCD or VFD vendor and model,
            the 'LCDd.conf' configuration file and
            (if you are using an LCD or VFD that connects using USB)
            the output of the command 'lsusb' with the LCD or VFD connected.
