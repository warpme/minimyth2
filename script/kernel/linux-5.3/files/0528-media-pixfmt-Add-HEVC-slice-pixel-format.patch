Subject: [PATCH 173/175] media: pixfmt: Add HEVC slice pixel format

Introduce the V4L2_PIX_FMT_HEVC_SLICE pixel format, which currently
describes an output buffer with enough appended slice data for
producing one decoded frame with a stateless video decoder.

This will need to be reworked (along with the controls and the core) to
allow passing slice data individually, as it is the natural decoding
unit in HEVC.

We also need to figure out the description of the possible source data:
* Compressed slice data only, with slice controls attached;
* Slice data in Annex-B format (with raw slice header), without slice
  controls attached;
* Slice data in Annex-B format (with raw slice header), with slice
  controls attached.
