          <div class="heading">How can I see the console output of mythfrontend?</div>
          <p>
            Minimyth2 redirects mythfrontend's console output to syslog.
            It is logged with the facility 'local0', the level 'info' and the tag 'mythfrontend'.
            Therefore,
            you can find mythfrontend's console output in the file '/var/log/messages',
            assuming you have not configured a network log server.

        <div id="cannot-mount-root-fs" class="section">
          <div class="heading">Why do I get "cannot mount root fs on block (1,0)"?</div>
          <p>
            There is at least one possible reason.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the memory allocated by the kernel for the RAM root file system is less than the size of the RAM root file system,
            then the RAM root file system will be incomplete and fail to mount.
            The 'ramdisk_size' boot line parameter sets the memory allocated by the kernel for the RAM root file system.
            The value of the 'ramdisk_size' parameter must be at least the size of the RAM root file system.
            You can find more information
            <a href="document-boot.html#network-pxelinux-ram">here</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Earlier versions of Minimyth2 used the 'ramdisk' boot line parameter rather than the 'ramdisk_size' boot line parameter.
            However, the kernel obsoleted 'ramdisk' in favor of 'ramdisk_size'.
            Therefore, Minimyth2 had to switch from 'ramdisk' to 'ramdisk_size'.
            If you are using the 'ramdisk' parameter,
            then you need to switch to using the 'ramdisk_size' parameter or you will see the above error when trying boot.
          </p>
          <p>
            Original versions of the Minimyth root file system fit in 128000KB of memory.
            As a result, the original versions of Minimyth documentation suggested that 'ramdisk_size' be set to 128000.
            However, with the addition of new functionality and the increase in the size of MythTV,
            multiple graphics drivers and compiling Miniyth2 with 64bit target, the Minimyth2 root file system no longer fits in 128000kB of memory.
            Therefore, users need to change 'ramdisk_size' from 128000 to something larger (e.g. 192000).
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="dvd" class="section">
          <div class="heading">Why can I play some DVDs but not other DVDs?</div>
          <p>
            There are at least two possible reasons.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first reason is that some DVDs are encrypted using CSS.
            In order to play these DVDs, you need libdvdcss.so.2.
            Because of legal issues surrounding other software that allows Linux users to play their legally purchased DVDs,
            libdvdcss.so.2 is not included in the binary Minimyth2 distribution.
            Although libdvdcss.so.2 is very different from this other software, legal concerns still exist.
            Because libdvdcss.so.2 only depends on Linux and glibc,
            you should be able to use any libdvdcss.so.2 that has been compiled for i386, i486 or i586.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once you have a copy of libdvdcss.so.2,
            you can add it to your Minimyth2 frontend at boot by including it in your extras file system
            (see the
            <a href="document-minimyth_conf.html#MM_EXTRAS_URL">MM_EXTRAS_URL</a>
            variable in the Minimyth2 configuration file).
            If you compile Minimyth2 yourself,
            then the extras file system image that the build system creates contains libdvdcss.so.2.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second reason is that some DVD drives require their region code to be set.
            You can set your DVD drive's region code using the 'regionset' utility that is included in Minimyth2.
            For information on how to use 'regionset', see the
            <a href="http://linvdr.org/download/regionset/README">regionset readme</a>.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="plugin-missing" class="section">
          <div class="heading">Why is my favorite Myth plugin missing from Minimyth2?</div>
          <p>
            There are two reasons that some Myth plugins are not included in Minimyth2:
            the plugin has not been requested, and
            the plugin depends on software that is not included.
          </p>
          <p>
            The following plugins have not been included because they depend on software not included in Minimyth2:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/index.php/MythArchive">MythArchive</a>
              is not included because it depends on
              <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div id="sensor" class="section">
          <div class="heading">Why are my temperature and fan sensors missing or wrong?</div>
          <p>
            You may notice that you get no output from your temperature and fan sensors.
          </p>
          <p>
            The reason for this is that the sensor chip's kernel module is not loading.
            Unfortunately there is no simple detection method for sensor chips.
            In order to "auto-detect" the sensor chip, Minimyth2 goes through a two step process.
            First, Minimyth2 attempts to detect the motherboard vendor and product.
            Second, Minimyth2 maps the motherboard vendor and product to sensor chip's kernel module.
            It is likely that this is not working for your motherboard,
            because Minimyth2 does not have the necessary information.
            If you
            <a href="http://minimyth2.freeforums.org">let us know</a>
            the motherboard vendor and product, the output of the command
            'cat&nbsp;/sys/class/dmi/id/modalias'
            and (if you know it) the sensor chip kernel module,
            then we can add the necessary information to Minimyth2.
          </p>
          <p>
            You may notice that either a sensor reports a temperature that is very wrong
            or a label next to a temperature or fan sensor is wrong.
          </p>
          <p>
            The reason for very wrong temperature readings on VIA EPIA motherboards is
            either the specific temperature sensors are not used by the motherboard
            or there is something wrong with the vt1211 sensors driver.
            I do not know which it is.
            However, it is safe to assume that the motherboard is not at a temperature that is below freezing.
          </p>
          <p>
            The reason for the wrong labels is that the motherboard vendor did not wire the sensors as suggested by the sensor chip vendor.
            As a result, while the values are correct, they are attributed to the wrong temperature or fan sensors on the motherboard.
            At some point, we may add motherboard specific sensors configuration files to address this problem.
          </p>

        <div id="MM_DEBUG" class="section">
          <div class="heading">Why doesn't MM_DEBUG work?</div>
          <p>
            People tend to have one of two problems when trying to enable debugging.
          </p>
          <p>
            First, they set MM_DEBUG in the wrong place.
            As mentioned in the
            <a href="document-configure.html#bootline">configuration obtained from the boot line section</a>,
            MM_DEBUG="yes" must be set on the boot line.
            If it is set in the Minimyth2 configuration file, then it will be ignored.
          </p>
          <p>
            Second, they quote the MM_DEBUG variable value incorrectly.
            As mentioned in the
            <a href="document-configure.html#bootline">configuration obtained from the boot line section</a>,
            unlike Minimyth2 variable values in the MiniMyth configuration file which should be single quoted ('),
            Minimyth2 variable values on the boot line must be either unquoted or double quoted (").
            Single quoted variable values such as MM_DEBUG='yes' will not work correctly.
