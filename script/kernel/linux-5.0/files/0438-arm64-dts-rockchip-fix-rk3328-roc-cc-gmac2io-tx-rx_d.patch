Subject: [PATCH 038/142] arm64: dts: rockchip: fix rk3328-roc-cc gmac2io
 tx/rx_delay

The rk3328-roc-cc board exhibits tx stability issues with large packets,
as does the rock64 board, which was fixed with this patch
https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/10178969/

A similar patch was merged for the rk3328-roc-cc here
https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/10804863/
but it doesn't include the tx/rx_delay tweaks, and I find that they
help with an issue where large transfers would bring the ethernet
link down, causing a link reset regularly.
