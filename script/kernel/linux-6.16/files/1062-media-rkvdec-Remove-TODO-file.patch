Subject: [PATCH 12/28] media: rkvdec: Remove TODO file

2 items are present in the TODO file:
 - HEVC support
 - Evaluate adding helper for rkvdec_request_validate

Missing HEVC support is not a reason for a driver to be in staging,
support for different features of the hardware can be added in drivers
in the main tree.

The rkvdec_request_validate function was simplified in
commit 54676d5f5630 ("media: rkvdec: Do not require all controls to be present in every request")
by not setting controls that have not changed.
As it now basically just calls vb2_request_validate(), there is no need
for a helper.

-* Support for HEVC is planned for this driver.
-
-  Given the V4L controls for that CODEC will be part of
-  the uABI, it will be required to have the driver in staging.
-
-  For this reason, we are keeping this driver in staging for now.
-
-* Evaluate introducing a helper to consolidate duplicated
-  code in rkvdec_request_validate and cedrus_request_validate.
-  The helper needs to the driver private data associated with
-  the videobuf2 queue, from a media request.
