Subject: [PATCH 138/333] MythWeather: Fix a SEGV on exit from setup screen

When starting with an empty database, select MythWeather from the
main menu.  A blank screen is shown.  Pressing back shows the setup
screen.  Press back again to the main menu and the FE aborts:

    Program terminated with signal 11, Segmentation fault.
    0  SourceManager::clearSources (this=0x92c40f0) at sourceManager.cpp:156
    156	    while (!m_scripts.isEmpty())
    0  SourceManager::clearSources (this=0x92c40f0) at sourceManager.cpp:156
    1  0xa67497c9 in ScreenSetup::~ScreenSetup (this=0xb21cef0,
        __in_chrg=<value optimised out>) at weatherSetup.cpp:110
    2  0xa6749c40 in ScreenSetup::~ScreenSetup (this=0xb21cef0,
        __in_chrg=<value optimised out>) at weatherSetup.cpp:130
    3  0xb25969de in qDeleteInEventHandler (o=0xb21cef0)
        at kernel/qobject.cpp:4277

When ScreenSetup's dtor is called, the m_sourceManager passed to the ctor
has already been deleted.
